Hello and welcome to my blog! I started this blog to document my journey to become a Security Ninja. I am doing this as a security engineer in Switzerland. At the same time, I am studying to get a degree in [Advanced Federal Diploma of Higher Education in cyber security](https://www.ict-berufsbildung.ch/weiterbildung/fachausweis/cyber-security-specialist-efa "only in german"). I am interested in everything related to IT security and hacking in general.
