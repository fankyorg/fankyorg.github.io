title: DNS Exfiltration Part1
---

A few weeks ago, I received a file with recorded network traffic from a teacher, with the hint that a password was hidden in this file. As it turned out, the password was sent via the DNS protocol (decoded). Even though I had already heard about DNS exfiltration, I was not able to find the password. That was very annoying. So that this does hopefully not happen to me again, I started to look deeper into the topic DNS exfiltration. 

## Introduction
As often, as a good guy in IT security, you must first understand how the bad guys act. Therefore, I recommend reading the following article:

- [Exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0010/) - MITRE (tactic)
- [Automated Exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/) - MITRE (technique)
- [Application Layer Protocol: DNS](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/004/) - MITRE (technique)
- [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/) - MITRE  (technique)
- [Introduction to DNS Data Exfiltration](https://www.akamai.com/blog/news/introduction-to-dns-data-exfiltration) - Akamai

After reading these articles (especially the one from akamai), I felt I had a general idea of DNS exfiltration. However, since this was not enough for me, I decided to rebuild the whole thing in my LAB. 

## LAB setup and exfiltration
 To have the full control over the data stream, I decided using only DNS servers inside my (segmented) network. My planned setup should at the end look like this. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DNSExfiltration1/laboverview.png) 

 First, I created an A record, which points to my Ubuntu DNS and a zone on my Microsoft DNS Server (which is the primary DNS of my client). After that I created a delegated zone. Here you can see an nslookup on my client.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DNS-Exfiltration1/nslookup.png)

With this delegation every DNS query to data.exfil.fanky.org is send to my Ubuntu server. 

And that is the crucial point of DNS exfiltration. If I want to send data outside a protected network. I can abuse DNS queries. Even If I have blocked DNS to the internet on my clients. I just need to initiate a domain name resolution request. It doesnâ€™t matter how I sent the data. I can do that for example via browser request, nslookup, curl, or, or. Its only important that I trigger a dns request to something.data.exfil.fanky.org. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DNS-Exfiltration1/data-nslookup-curl.png)
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DNS-Exfiltration1/browser.png)

On my ubuntu server I see the following:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/DNS-Exfiltration/ubuntu-capture.png)
*Note: attackers would "hide" the sent data by using encodeding like Base64. Then you are also able to send spaces, commas, dots and so on*

The firewall logs shows that there was no direct communication between the client (10.20.49.103) and the Ubuntu DNS server (10.20.48.10).

For the Ubuntu part I used [this article](https://hinty.io/devforth/dns-exfiltration-of-data-step-by-step-simple-guide/). If you want to build in your own LAB with a DNS server which is reachable via internet, then I highly recommend following this article.
